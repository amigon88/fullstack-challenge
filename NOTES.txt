Short Description of the problem resolution

1.- The first thing was to fetch the data using the code that was already here
2.- After fetching the data I’m checking the geolocation of the user and sorting based on the proximity (I took the code to get the distance from Stackoverflow)
3.- When the sort is completed I’m adding this data to the sidebar
4.- I added a button that will show only open places or all the places depending on the state, this is done taking advantage of the moment library and checking agains the current time


Future tasks/ improvements

* I would like to improve the time that takes to sort the locations because now is taking some time, probably I would do some caching here for the geolocation
* I would add the feature to go to the place when the name is clicked
* The add location button is not working correctly since it's adding everything twice, so I would like to fix that
* It would be nice to add a button in the map to get the current location of the user
* When you open the modal to edit it there is no a cancel button, would be a good enhancement
* Validations for forms are needed, that would help to check the backend side together with testing

Test comments
* Since this is a full stack test I would also include to add a couple of endpoints and handle the errors in order to check the backend side
* I suggest to add some unit tests at least for the backend and utils, that would give a better metric if people know how to write them
* It would be also good to have a guide style (like the airbnb guide), that would help to have consistency across the code baseline and we could measure if people adapt to the rules easily
